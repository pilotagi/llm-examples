Codebase audit summary

Key issues found and fixes applied

1) Dependency breakage risk
- Issue: requirements.txt did not pin versions for fast-moving LLM SDKs (openai, anthropic, langchain). Latest releases have breaking API changes that would make this app fail to start.
- Fix: Pin compatible versions.
  • langchain: <0.1.0 to keep legacy import paths (langchain.chat_models, langchain.llms, callbacks)
  • openai: <1.0.0 to keep openai.ChatCompletion.create API
  • anthropic: <0.3.0 to keep anthropic.Client, HUMAN_PROMPT/AI_PROMPT, and completion API

2) Chatbot message handling bug
- Issue: Chatbot.py appended the OpenAI SDK message object directly to session_state and then mixed bracket/dot access (msg["content"] vs msg.content). This causes inconsistent behavior and potential serialization issues across reruns.
- Fix: Normalize assistant responses to plain dicts {"role": ..., "content": ...} and use consistent access. Updated Chatbot.py accordingly.

3) LangChain agent input misuse
- Issue: pages/2_Chat_with_search.py passed the entire conversation history (list of dicts) to agent.run(), which expects a string input prompt. This would raise parsing errors.
- Fix: Pass the current user prompt string to agent.run().

4) Deprecated model usage in LangChain example
- Issue: pages/4_Langchain_PromptTemplate.py used the deprecated OpenAI completions model text-davinci-003, which may be unavailable.
- Fix: Switch to gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct for the legacy Completions API path used by langchain.llms.OpenAI.

5) Incomplete .gitignore and secrets location
- Issue: Only a minimal .gitignore existed and it ignored a top-level secrets.toml instead of the Streamlit default .streamlit/secrets.toml.
- Fix: Expanded .gitignore to common Python/Streamlit ignores and added .streamlit/secrets.toml.

Other observations and recommendations (not auto-changed)

6) Streamlit server security flags
- .streamlit/config.toml disables CORS and XSRF protections (enableCORS=false, enableXsrfProtection=false). This is fine for demos/local but not recommended for production deployments. Consider enabling these in production environments.

7) Migration to modern SDKs (optional future work)
- To move forward to the latest SDKs:
  • OpenAI: migrate to the 1.x client (from openai import OpenAI; client.chat.completions.create(...)) and update LangChain to the newer packages (langchain, langchain-community, and langchain-openai), or keep using ChatOpenAI from langchain-openai.
  • Anthropic: migrate to the Messages API (client.messages.create(...)) and the new message formatting, removing HUMAN_PROMPT/AI_PROMPT.
  • LangChain: Update imports to the new packages and adjust any API changes. This will require coordinated dependency upgrades.

8) Error handling and UX
- Consider adding explicit error handling around API calls (quota errors, invalid keys, network issues) and graceful fallback messaging to improve UX.

9) Rate limiting / streaming
- For the Chatbot, consider enabling streaming responses and/or lightweight rate limiting to avoid long waits and potential rate-limit API errors.

10) Testing
- There are no automated tests. Adding basic smoke tests for page imports and minimal function calls would help guard against dependency regressions.
